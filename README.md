# Codestrates 2

Codestrates builds on [Webstrates](http://webstrates.net). A web-page served from a Webstrates server is called a _webstrate_, and is a web-page where changes to the document object model (DOM) are persisted to the server and synchronized with other clients of the same page.

## Installation

To use Codestrates you need access to a [Webstrates](http://webstrates.net) server. Refer to the [Webstrates documentation](http://webstrates.github.io) for instructions on how to set one up.
To create a new codestrate on a Webstrates server check the prototypes folder for more instructions.
